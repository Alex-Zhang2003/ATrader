# ATrader

This is a project which wraps all of my previous and upcoming trading strategies. This is built with the aim of replicating some of the more professional trading framesworks, with the ultimate goal of becoming a generalizable trading framework, which can easily accommodate for new trading strateiges.

The trading framework uses IBKR's API for its order related actions. Its backend is hosted on a PostgreSQL database.

The project aims to have a Order Manager and Execution Manager to automatically handle the trading signals generated by different strategies.

This project is only used for the implementation of strategies, and research/backtests should be done seperately.
